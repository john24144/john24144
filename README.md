## Hi!

My name is Keith, and I'm currently working as a software developer at CAS.<br>
I've been in the software development field for about 2 years, with plenty more to look forward to.<br>
I've learned so far that I really don't like regex, undocumented code, or god classes.
<br><br>
Outside of work, I enjoy trying out different languages and frameworks, cooking, and playing D&D.
