## Hello.

My name is Keith, and I've just graduated from The Ohio State University.
So, now I'm looking for an entry level position that will test my abilities as a software developer.
Here's what you can count on me for:

 + I have plenty of programming languages under my belt, plus I can learn fast.
 + I have previous experience interning as a web developer.
 + I know how to be a team player and/or team leader.
 + I'm excited to enter the field to grow even more as a software engineer.
